# **CSY3025 Artificial Intelligence Techniques**
## **Assignment 2 – Image Classification using Deep Learning**

In supermarkets, customers often need to manually select fruit and
vegetables at the self-checkout as shown in the image below.

You are asked to join a team of engineers to develop a solution to automate the process of fruit/vegetable selection. A customer would place one type of fruit/vegetable at a time in a designated area before an overhead camera takes an image. Your task is to develop an image classifier that names the item in the image (from known categories). Your classifier needs to recognise **5 different fruit/vegetables** of your choice.

To complete the task, you must study the problem space, collect image dataset, train a deep learning classifier, and use appropriate method to showcase/visualise the performance of your classifier.

### **The deliverables of the assignments include:**
1. A working deep learning model implemented using TensorFlow
and Python. You must submit a Python notebook file (.ipynb) with all outputs saved.
 

2. A report that includes but not limited to the following sections:
*   **a. Cover page**
*    i. [optional] If your file size is larger than what’s permitted by the Turnitin submission point, then include a download link to your dataset (one drive, github, etc.)
*    ii. A link to a 5-minute demo video (e.g., screen recording) that walks through your design/implementation
*   **b. Introduction**
*   **c. Problem analysis and background research**
*   **d. Building deep learning network (explain how you make
choices at each following step)**
*   i. Dataset
*   ii. Network (structure, loss function, optimiser, etc.)
*   iii. Training and evaluation
*   iv. Testing
*   **e. Summary of additional features (if applies)**
*   **f. Discussions and conclusions**
*   i. Lessons learned
*   ii. Limitations
*   **g. Reference**

### **The marking will be based on:**
The marking will be based on:
1. 20% Problem analysis and background research
(demonstrate your general knowledge of deep learning and the
application scenario)
2. 30% Design (Architectural design of your application,
construction of dataset, test plans, etc. including additional features such as extra categories, exceptional model performance, user interface, etc.)
3. 40% Implementation (completion of the model, reasonable performance, and additional features)
4. 10% Report quality (quality of technical writing)
